**The Phidget strategy gives iotes a way connect to and receive or dispatch data to the series of phidget devices** 

Phidget is a brand for USB Sensing and Control devices. They can be be seen as a closed source alternatives to Arduinos, that take care of a lot of the implementation details for you. Phidgets are a good choice for robust, quick and easy to use physical control devices if you don't mind paying a bit extra over Arduinos and aren't worried about power consumption. 


:::caution Phidget Device Support
At the moment we are only supporting Rotary Encoders and RFID readers with the phidget strategy. This is because that is the only hardware we've had around to play with. Adding new devices is relatively easy, so if you have a physical phidget device you would like supported and wouldn't mind being a test case get in touch!  
:::

## Install

```bash
npm install @iotes/strategy-phidget22
```

## Use

```javascript
import { createIotes } from 'iotes'
import { phidgetStrategy } from 'iotes-strategy-phidget'

const topology = {
  // topology map
}

const iotes = createIotes({
  topology, 
  strategy: phidgetStrategy 
})
```

## About Phidget

Phidgets are both physical devices and a protocol designed to make usb sensors and controllers easy and quick to use. They can be used for education, exhibitions and prototyping.

In most languages phidget supports the phidget API directly communicates with a usb driver, in JavaScript however the apps send and receives messages from the app to a network server, which does the usb communication with the physical devices. Fortunatley the network server is pretty easy to set up either locally or on you local network following this [documentation](https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Phidget_Network_Server#Javascript). Once up and running iotes-phidget makes it easy address the devices.

Alternatively the Phidget SBC (Single Board Computer) is available which acts an the network server and provides plug point to devices using Phidgets proprietary VINT plugs       


## Iotes Phidget Topology

The Iotes Phidget strategy uses [Phidget.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/Phidget.js) for Phidget connection

### Hosts

- ```name``` : Your name for the broker you want to connect to. This can be anything you want and is not related to broker settings

- ```host``` : The address of the broker you wish to connect to. You **must** prefix this with the protocol which you wish to use. Generally from a browser this will be ```ws://``` or ```wss://``` as the browser will be able to use Phidget over websockets.

- ```port``` : The port on the host that the broker uses. According to Phidget documentation this should be ```8883``` for Phidget over websockets but in practice is often some port in the ```8xxx``` range. Check you broker documentation to find out

- ```strategyConfig```: *Optional* : You can use this to pass config information to Phidget.js. You can see the avliable options [here](https://github.com/mqttjs/Phidget.js#mqttclientstreambuilder-options)

#### Example:

```javascript
const topology = {
  // ...client
  hosts:[{
    name: 'myBroker', 
    host:'ws://test.mosquitto.org', 
    port: '8080', 
    strategyConfig: {} 
  }] 
  // ...devices
}
```
  
### Devices

- ```hostName```: The name of the host you want to connect this device to. This **must** match a name of one of your hosts from the ```host``` portion of your topology.

- ```type```: The type of connection you wish to make. With iotes-Phidget you have two options.
  
  - ```APP_CHANNEL``` : With *APP_CHANNEL* message will be subscribed and dispatched to the broker on ```{client.name}/{device.name}```. If you have an app made up of multiple services or interfaces that need to communicate you can use this to prefix your topic 

  - ```EXTERNAL_CHANNEL``` : With *EXTERNAL_CHANNEL* message will be subscribed and dispatched to the broker on ```{device.name}```. This is the way to subscribe to any given channel.

- ```name``` : The name for the device. This will translate in Phidget to the **topic** which iotes subscribes and publishes on. This actual topic name will depend on whether the ```type``` you have chosen   


#### Example:

```javascript
  const topology = {
    // ...client
    // ...hosts
    devices: [{ 
      hostName: 'myBroker',
      type: 'APP_CHANNEL',
      name: 'DEVICE'
    }]
  }  
```
