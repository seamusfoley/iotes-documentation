**The MQTT strategy gives iotes a way connect to and receive or dispatch data to an MQTT broker** 

Mqtt is an accessible, mature and widely used IOT protocol. If you don't know which strategy to use, or you are getting started with IOT use this one.


## Install

```bash
npm install @iotes/strategy-mqtt
```

## Use

```javascript
import { createIotes } from 'iotes'
import { mqttStrategy } from 'iotes-strategy-mqtt'

const topology = {
  // topology map
}

const iotes = createIotes({
  topology, 
  strategy: mqttStrategy 
})
```

## About MQTT

> Mqtt is a simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. It is designed to minimise network bandwidth and device resource requirements while attempting to ensure reliability, making it well suited to 'Internet of Things' connected devices, and for mobile applications where bandwidth and battery power are at a premium.

*Edited from [mqtt.org](http://mqtt.org/)*

MQTT works on a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model. Devices can publish messages to a **topic**, and devices can **subscribe** to a **topic**. When a device publishes a message to a **topic** all devices subscribed to that **topic** receive the message

All devices connect to a centralised **broker**. The broker receives the messages **published** to a **topic** and distributes the message to all devices **subscribed** to the **topic**

## Iotes Mqtt Topology

The iotes MQTT strategy uses [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js) for mqtt connection

### Hosts

- ```name``` : Your name for the broker you want to connect to. This can be anything you want and is not related to broker settings

- ```host``` : The address of the broker you wish to connect to. You **must** prefix this with the protocol which you wish to use. Generally from a browser this will be ```ws://``` or ```wss://``` as the browser will be able to use MQTT over websockets.

- ```port``` : The port on the host that the broker uses. According to mqtt documentation this should be ```8883``` for mqtt over websockets but in practice is often some port in the ```8xxx``` range. Check you broker documentation to find out

- ```strategyConfig```: *Optional* : You can use this to pass config information to mqtt.js. You can see the avaliable options [here](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js#mqttclientstreambuilder-options)

#### Example:

```javascript
const topology = {
  // ...client
  hosts:[{
    name: 'myBroker', 
    host:'ws://test.mosquitto.org', 
    port: '8080', 
    strategyConfig: {} 
  }] 
  // ...devices
}
```
  
### Devices

- ```hostName```: The name of the host you want to connect this device to. This **must** match a name of one of your hosts from the ```host``` portion of your topology.

- ```type```: The type of connection you wish to make. With iotes-MQTT you have two options.
  
  - ```APP_CHANNEL``` : With *APP_CHANNEL* message will be subscribed and dispatched to the broker on ```{client.name}/{device.name}```. If you have an app made up of multiple services or interfaces that need to communicate you can use this to prefix your topic 

  - ```EXTERNAL_CHANNEL``` : With *EXTERNAL_CHANNEL* message will be subscribed and dispatched to the broker on ```{device.name}```. This is the way to subscribe to any given channel.

- ```name``` : The name for the device. This will translate in MQTT to the **topic** which iotes subscribes and publishes on. This actual topic name will depend on whether the ```type``` you have chosen   


#### Example:

```javascript
  const topology = {
    // ...client
    // ...hosts
    devices: [{ 
      hostName: 'myBroker',
      type: 'APP_CHANNEL',
      name: 'DEVICE'
    }]
  }  
```

## Choosing a Broker

If you're not familiar with MQTT there are options to get a broker working.

- Public Brokers
  
  Public brokers are the quickest way to get started in development. They allow anyone to subscribe or dispatch to any topic. This is what we are using for the example [here](/docs/introduction/examples#basic-mqtt)

  [broker.hivemq.com](broker.hivemq.com)

  [test.mosquitto.org](test.mosquitto.org)

- Node js Broker

  Aedes allows you to set up you own broker as a node module.

  [https://github.com/moscajs/aedes](https://github.com/moscajs/aedes)


- Self Hosted

  [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is an open source MQTT broker suitable for heavy production use

- Commercial MQTT brokers

  [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/hivemq/) offer a commercial MQTT broker

  [AWS IOT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/) AWS's IOT core also uses mqtt (There is planned a strategy for aws iot specifically)
